  # XXX: doesn't work with more than 1 pod - requires Enterprise Edition :-(
  #      also must configure letsencrypt for Traefik specifically in values.yaml instead of just riding Cert Manager like with regular ingresses
  #      create Cert Manager certificate request separately instead and point it to the secret
  #  certResolver: letsencrypt
